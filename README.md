## üéØ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a **Roman Numeral Converter** page as part of the **JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures** curriculum on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

> üí° Inspired by:  
[Roman Numeral Converter Demo](https://roman-numeral-converter.freecodecamp.rocks)

## üìå Project Requirements

- [x] You should have an input element with `id="number"`
- [x] You should have a button element with `id="convert-btn"`
- [x] You should have a `div`, `span`, or `p` element with `id="output"`
- [x] Input should be validated:
  - Empty ‚ûù ‚ÄúPlease enter a valid number‚Äù
  - ‚â• 4000 ‚ûù ‚ÄúPlease enter a number less than or equal to 3999‚Äù
- [x] The app should display the correct Roman numeral result
- [x] Conversion works for common and complex cases (e.g., 9 ‚ûù IX, 3999 ‚ûù MMMCMXCIX)
- [x] Block invalid input via the UI (e.g., `-` sign or `e`)
- [x] Works with keyboard input + Enter key

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Be sure to include these lines in your HTML to link your files:  
> `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`  
> `<script src="script.js"></script>`

## ‚úÖ Project Tests (User Stories)

1. `#number` exists as an `<input>` element
2. `#convert-btn` exists as a `<button>` element
3. `#output` exists as a `<p>`, `<div>` or `<span>` element
4. Alert message appears if input is empty
6. Input ‚â• 4000 shows "Please enter a number less than or equal to 3999"
7. Input of 9 returns "IX"
8. Input of 16 returns "XVI"
9. Input of 649 returns "DCXLIX"
10. Input of 1023 returns "MXXIII"
11. Input of 3999 returns "MMMCMXCIX"
12. Input of negative numbers is blocked and shows the correct message
13. Large numbers (‚â• 4000) are blocked and show the correct message

## üñºÔ∏è Project Context

This is one of the required projects to earn the **JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures** certification from freeCodeCamp.  
Through this project, I practiced:

- Recursive string conversion logic
- Input sanitization & validation
- DOM interaction using Vanilla JavaScript
- Building a minimalist, responsive user interface
- Preventing invalid keyboard entries for better UX
